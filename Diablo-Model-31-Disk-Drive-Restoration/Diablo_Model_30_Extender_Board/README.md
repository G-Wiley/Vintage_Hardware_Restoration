<p>This Diablo Model 30 series extender board is helpful to more easily probe signals on the boards in the drive. 
The current version is v1. It now includes notches between P1 connector pins 2 through 9 to be compatible with some versions of the Diablo drives that have the corresponding keying shims in the backplane connectors.
It's easy to make one... order the PCB from JLCPCB and an edge connector from AliExpress. Gerber file, PCB ordering instructions, and BOM are in this folder.</p>
<p>Note that the photos below show the version v0 board. The current version, v1, has keying notches between pins 2 through 9 of the edge connector</p>
