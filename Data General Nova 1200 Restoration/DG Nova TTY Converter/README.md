The DG Nova TTY Converter is an accessory to use with the 107-000063 board (4010 BASIC I/O CONTROL DGC NOVA) that is configured as a Teletype Interface. This add-on board converts the Teletype interface signals to TTL levels so a USB Serial Converter cable can be use to connect to your Nova computer.
This board connects to only three pins on the Nova backplane in the slot where the 4010 board is plugged in:
<ul>
<li> pin A85, Nova TTY Serial Output</li>
<li> pin B69, Nova TTY Serial Input</li>
<li> pin B1, Nova TTY Backplane GND Connection</li>
</ul>
The converter board has a small surface-mount LED to indicate data activity. There is a location to install an optional larger T1-3/4 size LED. If this larger LED is installed, then remove the existing SMT LED.
