The DG Nova TTY Baud Rate Generator is an add-on to the 107-000063 board (BASIC I/O CONTROL DGC NOVA) that is configured at a Teletype Interface.
This board serves as a replacement for the 14.08 kHz oscillator circuit to generate baud rates from 150 bps to 38,400 bps. This add-on board uses a 4.9152 MHz crystal oscillator and a binary counter to produce the reference to the TTY interface. This reference frequency is 128 times the baud rate.
