The DG Nova TTY Baud Rate Generator is an add-on to the 107-000063 board (4010 BASIC I/O CONTROL DGC NOVA) that is configured as a Teletype Interface.
This add-on board allows the user to select baud rates from 150 bps to 38,400 bps. The board uses a 4.9152 MHz crystal oscillator and a binary counter to produce the frequency reference to the TTY interface, which is 128 times the baud rate. The existing reference clock on the 4010 Basic I/O Control board is a 14.08 kHz crystal oscillator that enables the board to operate at only 110 bps. This add-on board is convenient because the binary loader operates much faster.
